        "I had Bernardo over to do a small drywall repair in our powder room after we'd had some electrical work done. I called him in the morning, and he stopped by to estimate later that same day, and even started the job right then. Reasonably priced, worked efficiently and was careful not to leave a mess with drywall dust, etc. Also, was willing to fit in our very small job, which I appreciated. Will definitely contact him again.",

        "Bernardo and Frank both were wonderful.  As good as it gets!  Arrived on time, did exactly as they stated.  Installed drywall on all ceilings in one bedroom apartment, skim coated several walls.  Didn't play games or try to charge extra.  The quality was good and they worked fast.  Bid was one of the lower ones, quality was one of the best!  Will be using again.",

        'Bernardo is the man! After reading these positive yelp reviews, I decided to give him a call and have him bid on installing new drywall on my garage ceiling. Bernardo answered my call and came over to survey the job. Bernardo was very professional, and was able to give me a quote shortly after the walk through. He was well versed in commercial contracting and he was able to provide a certificate of insurance, which was a requirement of my condo building. He proposed a fair price, and got to work. He was able to replace the drywall ceiling in my garage while allowing me to park in the garage during the evenings. He pulled out the insulation and cleaned up the damaged areas without a hitch. I certainly recommend that you give him a call if you are considering any drywall job. Life is always easier when you know a good drywall guy, and Speedy Gonzalez is among the best there is!',

        'Bernardo is the man. We had a small, but complicated job that needed to be done in a limited time frame, while other workers were in our new house, and he more than delivered. Our main job was replacing a yucky tiled cracking plaster ceiling with drywall, and he even threw in a couple other fixes (replacing a folding door with drywall and fixing more cracked plaster in a cabinet) around the house for free. Free! We have a couple other jobs in the future that we will definitely be calling Bernardo for.',

        "Overall good experience. Bernardo was really easy to work with and his guys did a great job on a complete dry wall install and dry wall for our basement ceiling. They were always on time (8am) and worked until at least 4:30 throughout the whole week. Only dislike was some of his workers trashed our newly remodeled bathroom which had been cleaned. I expected them to clean up after themselves at the very end but that didn't happen. Bernardo apologized for his guys not cleaning up after themselves and said he would talk to them. Bernardo helped scrape off some of the mud that got on our basement floor and bathroom floor though before officially closing out the job. If I need another large dry wall project done I'd use them again but I'd ask for the ones (Juan and another guy didn't get his name) who I noticed did clean up after themselves and ensured everything was good before they left for the day. Overall happy with how the basement turned out and they did a good job removing the old paneling, installing new drywall, mudding, and taping. Price was pretty reasonable too!",

        "We've had Speedy come in three or four times over the course of our kitchen remodel.  They did the drywall over the entire room that we formerly had down to the studs, and they came in to do some patching on a few other areas later on down the line. The work is quite good, and his guys are unfailingly polite.  I wish Yelp offered half stars, because I rounded up from 4 1/2, only because Bernardo can sometimes be a little difficult to get a hold of to schedule the work.  That said, he's still my first call the next time I need drywall work done, and he should be yours too.",

        'I am so glad I found Bernardo.  They repaired the drywall on two bedrooms, fixed the windows and the casings, replaced the doors, installed closet doors, and painted the two bedrooms.  I am very pleased with the work and craftsmanship.  They worked constantly, and finished the work in 5 days.  They even worked with our schedule while our floors were being installed.  The price is reasonable for the quality of work they provide.  I picked them because of the good reviews I saw here.  I trust Bernardo and his crew.  I would hire him again for another project, and would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone.',

      comment:"We had some drywall we needed taped and painted and called Bernardo after seeing his excellent reviews on Yelp. His crew and Bernardo himself at times were completely excellent, great taping and painting skills. Timely in meeting out timetable and fair on price. Bernardo's enthusiasm and friendliness are another plus. We strongly recommend him and his company for your drywall taping and painting projects.",

      comment:"Bernardo and his team are a class act. No slacking here. His men worked extremely hard non-stop from the time they got to my house until they left. The quality to detail is the icing on the cake. Bernardo is a perfectionist. He wants things done right. Also,  Bernardo always tries to save you money by breaking down the quote so you can pick and choose which options you can squeeze or not squeeze into your budget. I could go on & on. Thanks Bernardo!",

      comment:"This guy and his company should be your Go-TO Drywall Company. WOW! Wow! Wow! Bernardo and his crew are AMAZING!!! great, friendly kind-hearted man and crew, and very respectuful of our space.Please DO NOT let his beautiful website make you feel that he is over-priced or will charge you an arm and a leg. He had no Yelp reviews but my husband and I acting as our own GCs remodeling a foreclosure we purchased, took a chance, not blindly though, we interviewed 3 companies, he was the most knowledgeable, and flexible and above all came in at our target budget which was very aggressive (he gave us the quote via text, which was fine with me because it is written and i would rather have my drywall guy busy with work and responding via texts than sitting at home trying to get quotes out and not working), his crew was flexible enough and they came in multiple days, working around multiple different jobs we had going on at the same time. We even cut out some of the drywall work they had previously done to get our staircase and window frames done right, NO problem, he came back out on his own time and re-drywalled around those things and told my hushand to call him if he needed him to come back and sand it down although it was so small we didnt care to - I mean, what a guyHis job is REALLY Clean and he added little aesthetics that we wouldnt have even thought of, to delineate rooms and to soften sharp lines and edges - he was our fav person we contracted with out of about 10 different companies that worked in our house.Bernardo - THANK YOU!!!! There are truly great, well priced companies out there, you just have to do your homework but look no further if you need drywall work done.",

    comment:"They call him Speedy but Bernardo does not take any shortcuts. He and his crew worked under not the best lighting conditions but did all the requested touchups, painting more than other estimates  offered, even leaving the proper drywall spacing for a new light fixture. We had been living under a collapsed bedroom ceiling due to the July microburst and were anxious to repair it, but had to put on a new roof first. With the seasonal window closing we squeaked in Bernardo's work from his multiple other jobs. He was polite, respectful, and above all extremely knowledgeable and experienced. I was nervous booking a non-local due to travel time issues with other contractors but his team was very reliable. My fastidious friends were impressed with the work and I was pleased with Bernardo's competitive pricing.",
